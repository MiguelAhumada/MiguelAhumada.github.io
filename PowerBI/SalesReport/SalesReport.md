## Sales report for January - April 2021

**Project description:** 

This work consists of a set of three reports connected to each other by the buttons on the left side panel. For the project, the following fictitious situation was considered:

A company has a staff of 20 vendors and a catalog of 10 different products. The managers are interested in analyzing the growth of the company for the period January - April 2021, and thus, to be able to plan sales strategies for the following period. They are interested in knowing the total sales, the net income for the period, evaluating the performance of their workers, as well as analyzing sales by product.

To display the information, the report was divided into 3 sub-reports. The first report is focused on the general sales data for the period, the second one shows detailed information on sales by product and the third one shows the performance of each worker.

To display detailed information, each of the reports are connected to the filters in the upper right panel.
