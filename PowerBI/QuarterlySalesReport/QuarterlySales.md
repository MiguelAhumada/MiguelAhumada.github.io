## Quarterly Sales Report

**Project description:** 

This work was elaborated as motivation after having finished the course "Microsoft Power BI - A Complete Introduction" by Udemy [LINK OF THE COURSE](https://www.udemy.com/course/powerbi-complete-introduction/).

For the project, a fictitious excel database was used, which consists of a quarterly record of total revenue of each of the vendors in a company, 
classified by product type: accessories, devices and systems; and the region in which they were sold: east, west and central.

For the elaboration of the report, I could practice some features of Microsoft Power Bi, such as:

- Import databases from Power Query Editor.
- Use different types of graphs depending on the type of information I wanted to show.
- Create y edit tables.
- Use slicers.
- Link Charts Using Filters.
- Customize and design a creative dashboard. 

The dashboard is shown below:
