## Sales history: Video game industry

**Project description:** 

The following report shows valuable information about video game sales throughout history. In the upper right panel, the report has a series of filters to be able to make detailed searches. From the visualizations we can obtain information such as:

- Number of copies sold (in millions) for each year, region, genre, platform or editorial.
- Annual video game sales by region, genre, platform or editorial.
- Regions with the highest percentage of sales by year, genre, platform or editorial.
- Most popular platforms for each year, region, editorial or genre.
- Most popular genres for each year, region, editorial or platform.
- Specific information on all of the above, thanks to the table inserted in the report.
