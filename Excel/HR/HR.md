## Human Resources Managment Dashboard

**Project description:** 

The following report shows valuable information about Human Resources (HR) for a given company. In the left panel, the report has a series of filters to be able to make detailed searches. From the visualizations we can obtain information such as:

- Total active employees for each month in the years 2015-2018.
- Number of active employees by ethnic group.
- Average Tenure in months.
- Number of active employees by region.
- Number of separations for each year.
- Termination reasons for each year.

In the upper panel you can find summary statistics, such as the total employees up to that moment, number of employees by gender, percentage of employees for different pay types (hourly or salary), percentage of employees by type of contract: full time or part time, distribution of ages and the turnover.

The dashboard is shown below:
