## Iris Flowers - Supervised Learning (K-Nearest Neighbors)

**Project description:** 


In this project, I will perform supervised machine learning using a classification model: the K-nearest neighbors.

The dataset contains data pertaining to iris flowers in which the features consist of four measurements: petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width. The target variable encodes the species of flower, which there are three possibilites: versicolor, virginica and setosa. This is one of the datasets included in the scikit-learn package. 

From measurements of the sepal and petals of an iris flower, with this code we can determine, with a certainty of 97.7%, the type of species to which it belongs.
