## Digits Recognition (MNIST) - Supervised Learning (K-Nearest Neighbors)

**Project description:** 

In this dataset, each sample is an 8x8 image representing a handwritten digit. Each pixel is represented by an integer in the range 0 to 16, indicating 
varying levels of black. In the project, I performed supervised machine learning (K-Nearest Neighbor) to determine to which digit, from 0 to 9, each image represents.
