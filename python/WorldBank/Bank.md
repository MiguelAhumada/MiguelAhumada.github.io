## Defining Functions - World Bank Data

**Project description:** 


In this project I used my recently-gained skills of writing user-defined functions, iterators, list comprehensions and generatos to wrangle and extract meaningful information from a real-world dataset: the World Bank Development Indicators dataset. This dataset contains data on 217 world economies for over half a century, from 1960 up until 2015
