**Project description:** 
In the following project I will perform a guided exploratory data analysis (EDA). The purpose of this project is to practice the knowledge adquired in my python courses about data analysis.

The original EDA was made it by Nimit Vanawat on August 12, 2021 (https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/08/how-to-perform-exploratory-data-analysis-a-guide-for-beginners/). In Nimit's project a brief introduction about the exploratory data analysis is given (definition and importance of the EDA to take insights from the data), as well as the application of EDA to a real problem

In order to perform the data, Nimit used the Automobile dataset taken from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/toramky/automobile-dataset. This dataset consist of data From 1985 Ward's Automotive Yearbook. According to kaggle description of the dataset "consists of three types of entities: (a) the specification of an auto in terms of various characteristics, (b) its assigned insurance risk rating, (c) its normalized losses in use as compared to other cars."

ALTHOUGH I FOLLOWED THE NIMIT'S PROCEDURE, MOST OF THE CODE WAS DONE BY ME.
