## Thomson problem on a Sphere

**Project description:** 
The study of this project is about the mathematical computation to minimize the Coulomb energy of a system of N charged particles constrained to move on the surface of the unitary sphere. The method applied was the dynamical method, imposing a damped force proportional to the velocities of the particles and leaving evolve the system to reach the minimal energy.

Keywords: Thomson, Sphere, Coulomb energy, Polyhedrons /sep Minimal energy
